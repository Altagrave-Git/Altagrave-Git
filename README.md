## Hi there, I'm Damon Turcotte! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a full-stack developer who builds web and mobile applications and the backend software that powers them. I'm passionate about creating smooth, efficient and unified systems of component applications to build unique online platforms that provide intuitive and memorable user experiences.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
- A fully local native mobile resume builder application using React Native, Redux, JavaScript and Paper UI.
- A cross-platform animated group chat application with a React Native-based frontend with custom UI, state and storage tools, a Django-based ASGI backend with WebSockets, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Knox, and avatar and environment generation handled by InkScape, Adobe After Effects, DaVinci Resolve, and Blackmagic Fusion.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning..
- Advanced React Native, Redux and Three.js techniques for animations, gestures, and state management.
- Advanced Django, Django Channels, and Django REST Framework techniques for responsive, scalable, and secure backend services.
- Unified full-stack development techniques using tools like Expo, Next.js and Solito.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on..
- Python or JavaScript-based open-source projects within the Django, Flask, React and React Native ecosystems.
- Novel or experimental authentication and authorization systems for the coming post-third-party-cookie era of the web.
