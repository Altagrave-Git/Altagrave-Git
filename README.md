## Hi there, I'm Damon Turcotte.

### I build web and mobile applications, and the backend software that powers them. I'm a full-stack developer with a focus on the frontend. I'm passionate about creating beautiful, responsive, and accessible user interfaces. I'm also a big fan of open-source software and I love to contribute to the community!

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
- A fully local native mobile resume builder application using React Native, Redux, JavaScript and Paper UI.
- A full-stack cross-platform animated group chat application with a React Native-based frontend with custom UI, state and storage tools, a Django-based ASGI backend with WebSockets, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Knox, and avatar and environment generation handled by InkScape, Adobe After Effects, DaVinci Resolve, and Blackmagic Fusion.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning..
- Advanced React Native, Redux and Three.js techniques for animations, gestures, and state management.
- Advanced Django, Django Channels, and Django REST Framework techniques for responsive, scalable, and secure backend services.
- Unified full-stack development techniques using tools like Expo, Next.js and Solito.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on..
- Python or JavaScript-based open-source projects within the Django, Flask, React and React Native ecosystems.
- Novel or experimental authentication and authorization systems for the coming post-third-party-cookie era of the web.
